    </p>
    <p>Déjà vu is the strange sense of having already experienced something, even if you know you haven't. Experts
      believe that this phenomena is most likely linked to memory in some manner. So, if you get déjà vu, it's possible
      that you've had a comparable experience previously. It's simply that you can't recall it.</p>
    <h2>Memory Loss</h2>
    <p>Déjà vu might be connected to differences in the brain's memory systems, causing sensory information to bypass
      short-term memory and instead reach long-term memory.</p>

    <h2>About the Brain</h2>
    <p>You could feel you're seeing something for the first time if your initial glimpse of it, such as a view from a
      hillside, didn't need your whole concentration. However, even if you weren't fully conscious of what you were
      seeing, your brain remembers the prior perception.</p>
    <h2>Past Life</h2>
    <p>It is thought that traumas from previous incarnations might manifest themselves in the present as dread or
      phobias. Some examples include dread of drowning, fear of a certain animal, fear of specific locations, and fear
      of a specific number, color, or item for no apparent reason.</p>
