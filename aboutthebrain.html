    <h2>About the Brain</h2>
    <p>You could feel you're seeing something for the first time if your initial glimpse of it, such as a view from a
        hillside, didn't need your whole concentration. However, even if you weren't fully conscious of what you were
        seeing, your brain remembers the prior perception.</p>
    <ul>
