    <h2>About the Brain</h2>
    <p><b>You could feel you're seeing something for the first time if your initial glimpse of it, such as a view from a
            hillside, didn't need your whole concentration. However, even if you weren't fully conscious of what you
            were
            seeing, your brain remembers the prior perception.</b></p>
