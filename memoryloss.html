    <h1>Memory Loss</h1>
    <p>Déjà vu might be connected to differences in the brain's memory systems, causing sensory information to bypass
        short-term memory and instead reach long-term memory.</p>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Memory loss (amnesia) is unusual forgetfulness. You may not be able to remember new events, recall one
            or more memories of the past, or both. The memory loss may be for a short time and then resolve
            (transient).
        </li>
        <li>Memory loss that disrupts daily life. Challenges in planning or solving problems. Difficulty completing
            familiar tasks at home, at work or at leisure. Confusion with time or place.</li>
        <li>Déjà vu could be linked to discrepancies in the memory systems of the brain, leading the sensory information
            to by-pass short-term memory and reach long-term memory instead.</li>
